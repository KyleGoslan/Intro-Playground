 ### Challange
 As a final task, bring together everything we've looked at so far. Create a simple `Basket` class to represent a shopping basket that we can add some items to (these can just be `Floats`).
 
 The basket should be able to do a few things:
 
 * Add item(s).
 * Know how many items have been added.
 * Know the total price.
 * Empty the basket.
 
 Tips: You only need **one** class to begin with (you can elaborate later with another). As always, solve things in the most simple way possible first.

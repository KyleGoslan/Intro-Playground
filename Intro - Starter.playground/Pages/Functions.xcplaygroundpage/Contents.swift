 ### Functions 
 * Functions let us group together code that can be reused.

 * Functions can range from a few lines to hundreds (although that might be considered bad).

 ### Functions
 * Functions can accept "parameters" or "arguments" to alter their behaviour.
 * You specify a name for the arguments and its type.
 * This can then be used as a constant value within the function.

### Arrays
 * Arrays are one of three "collection" types in Swift.
 * The contents of the array should be of the same `Type`.
 * Info: [The Swift Standard Library Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/CollectionTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH8-ID105)

//TODO: Create an array of Ints and and array of Strings.

/*:
 ### Empty Arrays
 * Often you might want to create an empty array, and add to it later.
 * This is done by specifying the type of object the array with contain.
 * Info: [The Swift Standard Library Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/CollectionTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH8-ID105)

//TODO: Add some values to the array.

/*:
 ### Accessing arrays
 * There are several ways to get data out of an array.
 * Arrays are zero indexed (the first value is at position 0).
 * Info: [The Swift Standard Library Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/CollectionTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH8-ID105)

//TODO: Get the first item.
//TODO: Get the last item.

/*:
 ### Iterating Over an Array
 * One of the most common things to do with a collection is to loop through it.
 * This is most commonly done with a for loop.
 * It repeats an action for every item in your collection.
 * Info: [The Swift Standard Library Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/CollectionTypes.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH8-ID105)

//TODO: Loop through one of your arrays and print out each value.

 ### Other Common Tasks
 * Some other common things you might do with arrays.

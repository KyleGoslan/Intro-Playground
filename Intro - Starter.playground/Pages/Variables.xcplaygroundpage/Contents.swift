### Vars & Constants
 * Variables & Constants are how we keep track of things.
 * They are defined with either 'var' for variable or 'let' for constant.
 * Following this a name and either a type or value.
 * Best practice dictates that you should create a constant and change it to a var when needed.

//TODO: Create a simple number variable & constant.

/*:
 ### Type Annotations
 * You can specify the 'Type' you are creating by using a colon.
 * This is exactly the same as above.
 * The preferred way is to let swift infer the type for you.

//TODO: Example of specifying an exact type.

/*:
 ### Changeing Values
 * As the names suggest variables can change, constants can not.

//TODO: Change the value of a variable you created about using some basic operators.

/*:
 ### Strings
 * Strings work the same as numbers but come wrapped in quotation marks.

//TODO: Create a constant for both you first and last name.
//TODO: Add them together to create one for your full name.

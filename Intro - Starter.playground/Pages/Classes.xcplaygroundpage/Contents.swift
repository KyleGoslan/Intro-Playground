 ### Classes
 * Classes bring everything that we've discussed so far together.
 * Classes are blueprints for "objects".
 * Objects have "properties". These are their variables/constants.
 * Objects have "methods". Their functions.
 * Info: [Swift Classes Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/ClassesAndStructures.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014097-CH13-ID82)

//TODO: Create a simple class that represents a person. The person should have at least two properties, an age and a name. Also one function "haveBirthday" function that increases the persons age.

/*:
 * We create a person "instance" similar to how we created other variables.
 * We can then access it's properties and methods by using the name of instance and then a period.

//TODO: Create an istance of your person object you created above.
